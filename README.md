## Synopsis

    A basic Pokedex application I created for class using PHP, Bootstrap and MySQL

## Motivation

    I got really, really, bored and decided to create a Pokedex
    for personal use as well as a final project for a college course

## Installation

    All you really need are the pokemon sprites from [Veekun](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads)
    Place the sprites from pokemon\main-sprites\black-white\ => ./imgs
